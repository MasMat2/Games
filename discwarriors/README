DESCRIPTION:

The world is unknowing of a new age of technological advances in a vast island in the Bermuda Triangle. In this country, the most advanced thing is the E-World. It's an electronic world that people can actually travel to. You can live, eat, and breathe there. To do this though, you need a Desyn, and a Runner. A Desyn is an electronic being that you use to go into the E-World by merging with them to give you the strength to go around and fight of bugs or bullies. A Runner is the device that holds the Desyn while you are in the real world, holds your discs, and transports you through the two worlds.
